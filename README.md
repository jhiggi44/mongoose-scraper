# mongoose-scraper
A news scraper for the latest Nintendo news. Each article is scraped from "https://mynintendonews.com/". This app allows you to add notes to each article, which are saved for future viewing. 

# to use:
1. clone repo
2. install dependencies with "npm install." I've used mongoose, express, cheerio, body-parser, and handlebars to create this project. 
3. run mongo locally using "mongod" via the command line.
4. With mongo running locally, you can now start the server by typing "node server.js," which will allow you to view the app in your browser on port 3001. 
5. Finally, scrape Nintendo news, annotate, and have fun.
